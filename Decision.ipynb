252,   col.  1 to 2).   2.   fink teaches   physicians at the moffitt cancer center have about 150  clinical trials available for cancer patients.  they have  identified criteria that determine a

11/880,453   each trial, and they use these criteria to  select trials for  eligible patients.  traditionally, physicians have selected  trials by a manual analysis of patients\\' data.  the review of  resulting selections has shown that they usually do not check  all clinical trials and occasionally miss an appropriate trial.  to  address this problem, we have developed an expert  system that helps to select trials for each patient.   (fink 242, col.  2 to 243, col.  1).   3.   fink teaches a \"knowledge base [that]  includes questions,   medical tests, and logical expressions that represent eligibility criteria for   each trial\" (fink 243, col. 2).   4.   fink teaches that \"the system continuously re-evaluates the   patient\\'s eligibility and shows the decision for each trial.  if the patient is   ineligible for some trials, the user can find out the reasons by clicking the   \\'why\\' button\" (fink 246, col.  1)   5.   fink teaches that   if the knowledge base includes multiple clinical trials, the  system checks a patient\\'s eligibility for each of them.  it first  prompts the clinician to enter the personal data for a patient,  then asks for the tests related to multiple trials, and finally  requests additional tests for specific trials.  after getting  each new answer, the system re-evaluates the patient\\'s  eligibility for each trial.  it displays the list of matching  trials, rejected trials, and trials that require additional  information.

(quoting mayo,  132  s.  ct.  at  1297).  in other words, the second step is to   \"search for an \\'inventive concept\\' - i.e., an element or combination of   elements that is  \\'sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to   significantly more than a patent upon the  [ineligible concept] itself.\"\\'  id.   (brackets in original) (quoting mayo,  132  s.  ct.  at  1294).   alice involved \"a method of exchanging financial obligations between   two parties using a third-party intermediary to mitigate

alice\\'s \"concept of intermediated settlement\"   12    \\n appeal2013-006797  application 11/880,453   was held to be \"\\'a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our   system of commerce.\"\\'  134 s.  ct.  at 2356.  similarly, the court found that   \"[ t ]he use of a third-party intermediary ... is also a building block of the   modem economy.\"  id.  \"thus,\" the court held, \"intermediated settlement   ... is an \\'abstract idea\\' beyond the scope of ยง 101.\"  id.   claim 1 of the instant application is directed to a computer-aided   method for determining participation by a patient in a clinical trial for a   medical therapy that involves steps of determining statistical information   associating mitochondrial dna information with clinical outcomes of a   medical therapy, creating inclusion and exclusion criterion based on that   information for a clinical trial of the medical therapy, communicating the   statistical information, inclusion, and exclusion criterion, and determining   eligibility of patients for the therapy based on the inclusion and exclusion   criterion.   11).   in this regard, claim 1 is directed to the abstract idea of how to   determine participation in a clinical trial.  as evidenced by the obviousness   rejection above, determining statistical correlations between mitochondrial   dna information and clinical outcome is not an inventive concept (ff  12-  16), nor is the use of a computer to create and communicate inclusion and   exclusion criteria that determine eligibility for clinical trials inventive (ff  1-  now that we have completed the first step of determining whether the   claims recite an abstract idea, we tum to the second step outlined in alice,   i.e., we determine whether the recitations in claim 1 such as \"determining,   with a computing device\" or \"creating, in a computing device\" relate to an   13    \\n appeal2013-006797  application 11/880,453   inventive concept that is significantly more than the abstract idea of how to   determine participation in a clinical trial.  we conclude that it does not.   the recitations of \"determining, with a computing device\" or   \"creating, in a computing device\" amount to little more than reciting that the   computer system applies the abstract idea of how to determine participation   in alice, the court turned to its previous decisions in mayo, bilski,   diamondv. diehr, 450 u.s.  175  (1981), parkerv. flook, 437 u.s.  584   (1978), and gottschalkv. benson, 409 u.s.  63  (1972) as  instructive on this   in a clinical trial.   question:   [mayo,  bilski, diehr, flook, and benson] demonstrate that  the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a  patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible  invention.  stating an abstract idea \"while adding the words  \\'apply it\\'\" is not enough for patent eligibility .... nor is  limiting the use of an abstract \"\\'to a particular technological  environment.\" ... stating an abstract idea while adding the  words \"apply it with a computer\" simply combines those  two steps, with the same deficient result.  thus, if a patent\\'s  recitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to  \"implemen[t]\" an abstract idea \"on ... a computer,\" ... that  addition cannot impart patent eligibility.  this conclusion  accords with the pre-emption concern that undergirds our ยง  101 jurisprudence.  given the ubiquity of computers ... ,  wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the  sort of \"additional featur[ e ]\" that provides any \"practical   14    \\n appeal2013-006797  application 11/880,453   assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort  designed to monopolize the  [abstract idea] itself.\"   alice,  134 s.  ct.  at 2358 (internal citations omitted).   we also reject the remaining claims on appeal under 35 u.s.c.  ยง 101.   these claims recite patent ineligible subject matter as well because they   either are similarly flawed as claim 1 in stating abstract ideas that are simply   implemented on computers, as in the case of independent claims 26, 45, 70,   and 89, or include the patent-ineligible subject matter recited in the   independent claims and merely further define the rules used to determine   participation in the clinical trial.  as such, the remaining claims may further   define the abstract idea of claim 1 but do not add an inventive concept that is   significantly more than the abstract idea.   summary   in summary, we vacate the examiner\\'s prior art rejections.   we reject claim 1under35 u.s.c.  ยง 103(a) as obvious over fink,   papaconstantinou, and washizuka.   we reject claims 1,  3,  5,  6,  8,  11,  14, 22, 26, 28, 29, 31, 34, 37,
