Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. § 134 from the Examiner’s   rejection of claims 1-4.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).   The Examiner maintains two rejections, a rejection of claim 3 under   35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 2, and a rejection of claims 1-4 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)   as anticipated by or, in the alternative, under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) as obvious  over Yamashita1.   However, Appellants present arguments only for the   rejection of claims 1-4 over Yamashita.  As Appellants have not shown that   the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 3 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 2, we   summarily affirm that rejection.   Turning to the rejection of claims 1-4 over Yamashita, we note that   Appellants do not argue any claim apart from the others.  We select claim 1   as representative for deciding the issues arising for that rejection.   Claim 1 reads as follows:   1.  A cleaning composite comprising melamine-based  foam having one or more lines of frangibility that divide the  cleaning composite into rows of rectangular shaped pieces, with  each row having a common line of frangibility.   (Claims App. at Br. 6.)   There is no dispute that Yamashita describes a cleaning tool having a   melamine resin foam body (abrasive member 3) (Yamashita, ¶ (0008)).    These cleaning tools are formed from the unfolded cleaning tool shown in   Figure 1.  Figure 1 is reproduced below:                                                               1 Yamashita, JP 2001/169985, pub. Jun. 26, 2001, as translated.

Or, for example, a cleaning block  may have lines of frangibility that divide the block into two  rows of rectangular-shaped pieces, with each row having one  common line of frangibility placed centrally along one of the  dimensions of the initial block (e.g., akin to the two rows of  rectangular-shaped pieces of chocolate in a Hershey\\'s®-brand  chocolate bar).   (Spec. 15:13-25 (emphasis added).)  Appellants’ Figure 3, similarly to   Appellants Demonstrative Drawing, shows a line 30 dividing the columns   created by the other lines of frangibility.      The Specification does not define “common line of frangibility” (See   Spec., generally).   During examination, \"claims . . . are to be given their broadest   reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification, and . . . claim   language should be read in light of the specification as it would be   interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art.\"  In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech.   Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Absent claim language carrying   a narrow meaning, we only limit the claim based on the specification when   those sources expressly disclaim the broader definition.  In re Bigio, 381   F.3d 1320, 1324-25 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  “[A]s applicants may amend claims to   narrow their scope, a broad construction during prosecution creates no   unfairness to the applicant or patentee.”  In re ICON Health and Fitness,   Inc., 496 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2007).        While the Specification discusses placing a “common line of   frangibility” in a particular orientation that is in concert with Appellants’   5   \\x0cAppeal 2010-004696  Application 11/414,101    Demonstrative Drawing, we cannot say that the claim is particularly limited   to this disclosed orientation.  The Specification does not define “common   line of frangibility,” nor does the Specification otherwise limit the “common   line of frangibility” to only the line in the orientation discussed in the   Specification.  Moreover, the word “common” is not alone descriptive of a   line running perpendicular and dividing the rows created by the other lines   of frangibility.  It is reasonable to interpret “common” as referring to a line   of frangibility common to two rows of melamine based composite if the   rows share the line of frangibility.  This interpretation gives weight to all   words in the claim, without reading limitations from a specific embodiment   into the claim.  Therefore, we agree with the Examiner that the “common   line of frangibility” of the claim encompasses one of the lines of frangibility   taught by Yamashita.      We sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 1-4 under 35 U.S.C. §   102(b) or, in the alternative, under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).  We also summarily   sustain the rejection of claim 3 under 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 2.   The Examiner’s decision is affirmed.
